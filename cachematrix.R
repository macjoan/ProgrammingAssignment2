## They are two functions, one creates a special matrix 
## and the second calculates the inverse
## or get it from cache

## Tis function set and get the value of the matrix
## and set and get the value of the inverse matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function return a inverse of a matrix or take the value of
## inverse matrix from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(X, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'X'
}
